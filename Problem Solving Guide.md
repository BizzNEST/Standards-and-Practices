## Hello future BizzNest Interns!
This is a quick guide on how you can problem solve effiecntly!:D
Step 1: Do some reasearch for the problem you are trying to tackle. Some good research practices are asking chatgpt or going on forums/google searching.
Step 2: Ask a peer or lead if you can't find the answer to it.
Step 3: Ask Alex if you weren't able to solve the issue with your peers. P.S Its okay to ask for help everyone runs into issues at times.
