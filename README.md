#### Git

- **Workflow**: Follow the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow:
  - Maintain `main` and `development` branches.
  - Branch off `development` for new features.
  - Request code reviews for your Pull Requests to `development`.
  - Merge reviewed code into `development`.
  - For milestone completion, create a `release` branch from `development`, QA it, then merge into `main` (tag it) and back into `development`.
  - For hotfixes, branch off `main`, fix the issue, then merge back into `main` (tag it) and `development`.
